This was a small project to go through the full stack, end-to-end process of developing and deploying a dashboard to display data visualzations, based on data from the World Bank. This project incorporated both back end and front end technologies to: 

- Wrangle World Bank data
- Create data visualizations
- Organize those visualizations on a web page
- Deploy that web page so anyone with an internet connection can see it

The technologies used for this project included:

* Python
* JavaScript
* Pandas
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* Plotly
* Flask
* Heroku

The dashboard itself can be viewed here:
